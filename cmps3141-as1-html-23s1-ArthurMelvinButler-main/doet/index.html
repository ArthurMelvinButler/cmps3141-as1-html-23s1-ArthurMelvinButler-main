   <h1>Problem with Coffee Cup Lids</h1>

   <img class="report-img" src="./images/R.jpg" alt="Clothes Iron"> 
 

   <p>The usability problem with coffee cup lids lies in their difficulty to securely attach to the cup. When attempting to put on the lid, users often find that it doesn't align properly, leading to potential leaks or spills. This issue affects several dimensions of usability, particularly learnability, efficiency, and safety.</p>
 
   <h2>Learnability</h2>
   <p>Users should be able to intuitively understand how to attach the lid without any confusion. When the lid doesn't easily fit or align, users might struggle to figure out the correct way to secure it, impacting the learnability aspect of usability.</p>
 
   <h2>Efficiency</h2>
   <p>The process of fitting the lid should be quick and effortless, especially for people on the go. When users have to spend extra time adjusting or repositioning the lid to avoid leaks, the efficiency of using the cup is compromised.</p>
 
   <h2>Safety</h2>
   <p>The potential for leaks or spills due to improperly attached lids presents a safety concern, as hot liquids can cause burns or damage. Users might have to take extra caution while carrying the cup, reducing the sense of safety in using the product.</p>
 
   <h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
   <p>To address this usability problem, manufacturers could consider implementing the following solutions:</p>
   <ul>
	 <li><strong>Design Improvement:</strong> Redesign the coffee cup and lid interface to ensure a more intuitive and foolproof attachment mechanism. This might involve using a lid design that only fits in one orientation, eliminating the possibility of misalignment.</li>
	 <li><strong>Visual Cues:</strong> Incorporate visual cues on the lid and cup to guide users on the correct way to attach the lid. Arrows, symbols, or color-coded indicators can help users quickly understand the proper orientation.</li>
	 <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Conduct thorough user testing to identify any issues with the lid design. Gathering feedback from a diverse group of users can help uncover potential problems and inform design refinements.</li>
	 <li><strong>Instructional Labels:</strong> Place clear instructions on the lid or cup packaging that guide users on how to properly attach the lid. This can help users who are unfamiliar with the cup's design.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>By addressing these aspects, coffee cup lids can become more user-friendly, reducing the potential for leaks and spills, enhancing the overall experience, and ensuring a safer usage environment.</p>

	 <h1>Problem with Refrigerator Organization</h1>
	 <img class="report-img" src="./images/ref.jpeg" alt="Clothes Iron">
	 <p>The problem with refrigerator organization arises when the interior design of the refrigerator doesn't efficiently accommodate the arrangement and accessibility of items. Shelves might be too narrow or spaced too closely together, leading to a lack of space for storing various-sized containers. This issue impacts several dimensions of usability, particularly efficiency and learnability.</p>
   
	 <h2>Efficiency</h2>
	 <p>Inefficient refrigerator organization leads to difficulty in finding and accessing items. Users might have to move multiple items to reach something at the back, causing frustration and potentially leading to food wastage as items get buried and forgotten.</p>
   
	 <h2>Learnability</h2>
	 <p>When refrigerator compartments lack clear organization and intuitive arrangement, users may find it challenging to figure out the optimal way to store their groceries. The lack of a coherent organization system hinders the learnability aspect of usability.</p>
   
	 <h2>Potential Solution</h2>
	 <p>To address the problem of refrigerator organization, manufacturers could consider implementing adjustable shelving, removable dividers, and clearer labeling. By allowing users to customize the internal layout to suit their needs, they can optimize space and find items more easily. Incorporating transparent shelves and drawers could also help users quickly identify items without having to open each compartment. Clear labeling or color-coding for different sections can enhance learnability and make it easier for users to intuitively organize their groceries. Such improvements would significantly enhance the efficiency and overall usability of the refrigerator.</p>

	<h1>Problem with Door Handles in Public Places</h1>
	<img class="report-img" src="./images/door.jpg" alt="door">
	<p>The problem with door handles in public places occurs when their design and functionality create challenges for users in terms of ease of use and safety. Many door handles in public spaces are designed in a way that requires users to push, pull, or turn them in unconventional or non-intuitive directions. This leads to confusion, especially for those encountering the door for the first time. This issue negatively affects several dimensions of usability, primarily learnability, efficiency, and safety.</p>
  
	<h2>Learnability</h2>
	<p>The non-standard or counterintuitive design of door handles makes it difficult for users to quickly understand how to operate them. People expect doors to open in a certain way, and when handles deviate from that expectation, it hampers the learnability aspect of usability.</p>
  
	<h2>Efficiency</h2>
	<p>Users spending extra time trying to figure out how to operate a door handle or repeatedly trying different actions to open the door reduce the efficiency of movement within a space. This is particularly important in high-traffic areas where quick and smooth access is crucial.</p>
  
	<h2>Safety</h2>
	<p>Door handles that are difficult to operate can pose safety risks, especially during emergencies. In panic situations, users might struggle to unlock or open doors swiftly, potentially endangering individuals inside a building.</p>
  
	<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
	<p>To address the problem of door handles in public places, designers should prioritize intuitive design that aligns with users' expectations. Incorporating universal symbols or icons indicating the correct action (push, pull, or turn) can help users quickly understand how to operate the door. Lever-style handles that require a simple downward press or upward pull are often more intuitive than traditional knobs. Regular user testing and feedback collection can help identify problematic door handle designs and inform necessary improvements. Ultimately, the goal is to create door handles that are easy to use, efficient, and promote safety, especially during emergencies.</p>
