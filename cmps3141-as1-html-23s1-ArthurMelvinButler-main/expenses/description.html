    <h1>Usability Issues with Expense Tracking Spreadsheet</h1>
    
    <h2>Learnability</h2>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Complex Formula Usage - If the spreadsheet relies heavily on complex formulas or calculations that users aren't familiar with, it can be challenging for Neo and Trinity to learn how to use and modify the spreadsheet effectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This affects learnability, as it increases the learning curve and can lead to errors if not used correctly.</p>
    
    <h2>Efficiency</h2>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Manual Calculation Errors - Manually calculating amounts owed and inputting them into the spreadsheet can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is especially true as the number of transactions increases.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This affects efficiency, as it requires more effort and time to perform tasks correctly.</p>
    
    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Lack of Data Validation - Without proper data validation, users might input incorrect amounts or descriptions, leading to inaccurate calculations or confusion.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This affects safety, as it increases the likelihood of errors and makes it harder to recover from mistakes.</p>
    
    <h2>Efficiency</h2>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Cumbersome Tracking - Over time, as the number of transactions accumulates, the spreadsheet might become difficult to navigate and manage, potentially leading to missed or duplicate entries.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This affects efficiency, as it slows down the process of inputting, reviewing, and settling transactions.</p>
    
    <h2>Learnability</h2>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Lack of User-Friendly Interface - If the spreadsheet lacks a clear and intuitive interface, new users might struggle to understand how to input data and navigate the various columns and categories.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This affects learnability, as it adds complexity to the process of using the spreadsheet.</p>
    
    <h2>Efficiency</h2>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Difficulty in Spotting Anomalies - Identifying anomalies (transactions that deviate from the norm) might be challenging, especially as the spreadsheet grows. This could lead to inaccurate tracking of shared expenses.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This affects efficiency, as it slows down the process of identifying and addressing anomalies.</p>
    
    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Data Loss Risk - If the spreadsheet is not backed up properly, there's a risk of data loss due to technical issues or accidental deletion.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This affects safety, as it jeopardizes the integrity of the financial records.</p>
    
    <p>To address these usability problems and improve the overall experience, Neo and Trinity might consider transitioning to a dedicated financial management app or tool designed for couples. These tools often offer automated expense tracking, user-friendly interfaces, automatic calculations, and data validation, addressing many of the issues associated with using spreadsheets for this purpose.</p>
